    <p> Mahendra Singh Dhoni ([məˈɦeːnd̪ɾə ˈsɪŋɡʱ ˈd̪ʱoːniː] ⓘ; born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer
        who plays as a right-handed batter and a wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific
        wicket-keeper batsmen and captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in
        limited overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the most
        international matches and is the most successful Indian captain. He has led India to victory in the 2007 ICC
        World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, being the only captain to win
        three different limited overs ICC tournaments. He also led the teams that won the Asia Cup in 2010 and 2016, and
        he was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.

        Born in Ranchi, Dhoni made his first class debut for Bihar in 1999. He made his debut for the Indian cricket
        team on 23 December 2004 in an ODI against Bangladesh and played his first test a year later against Sri Lanka.
        In 2007, he became the captain of the ODI side before taking over in all formats by 2008. Dhoni retired from
        test cricket in 2014 but continued playing in limited overs cricket till 2019. He has scored 17,266 runs in
        international cricket including 10,000 plus runs at an average of more than 50 in ODIs.

        In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Dhoni plays for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), leading them to the final on ten
        occasions and winning it five times (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023) jointly sharing this title with Rohit
        Sharma . He has also led CSK to two Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. Dhoni is among the few batsmen
        to have scored more than five thousand runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.

        In 2008, Dhoni was awarded India's highest sport honour Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by Government of
        India. He received the fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third highest civilian award Padma
        Bhushan in 2018. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian
        Territorial Army which was presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011. In June 2025, he was inducted into ICC
        Cricket Hall of Fame.

        Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and
        Devaki Devi.[2][3] His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the
        youngest of three children.[4][5][6] His family spells the surname as "Dhauni".[7] The spelling "Dhoni" emerged
        due to a spelling mistake in his school certificates and, despite repeated attempts by his family, has never
        been rectified.[8]

        Dhoni did his schooling from DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, where he started playing football as a goalkeeper, but
        later moved to play cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee.[9][10] From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni
        worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern Railway zone of Indian Railways

    <h2 id="youth-career">Youth Career</h2>
    <p> Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s cricketing journey began with humble roots and a passion that grew steadily over time.
        His early exposure to competitive cricket started when he represented the Commando Cricket Club from 1995 to
        1998. During these formative years, he played primarily as a wicket-keeper while simultaneously honing his
        batting skills. His swift glove work and ability to remain calm under pressure made him stand out, even at a
        young age. Coaches and teammates admired his composure, commitment, and natural cricketing instincts.

        By 1998, Dhoni’s abilities had evolved enough to catch the attention of selectors at the Central Coalfields
        Limited (CCL) cricket team. This transition played a crucial role in shaping his future. At CCL, Dhoni was not
        only entrusted with wicket-keeping duties but also promoted higher up the batting order. This tactical decision
        gave him the platform to showcase his natural flair for aggressive batting. His fearless approach to
        stroke-making impressed many, and he contributed significantly to the team's success. With Dhoni’s involvement,
        CCL successfully advanced to a higher cricketing division — a milestone that added confidence and recognition to
        his growing career.

        His consistent performances in district-level and club-level matches did not go unnoticed. As a result, Dhoni
        earned an opportunity to participate in the well-regarded Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship during the
        1997–98 season. Competing in this tournament exposed him to a higher level of competitive cricket and served as
        a platform to measure his skills against some of the best young talents in the region. Though still early in his
        journey, the experience helped broaden his cricketing vision and strengthened his resolve to excel further.

        Dhoni’s progression continued when he represented the Bihar Under-19 team in the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy.
        Over the course of five matches, he accumulated 176 runs. Although the number may not have been extraordinarily
        high, it reflected steady improvement. More importantly, his aggressive batting style and effectiveness as a
        wicket-keeper were becoming more apparent.

        His breakthrough phase in youth cricket arrived during the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy season. Dhoni’s
        performance in this edition of the tournament was exceptional, both as a batsman and as a wicket-keeper. Bihar
        qualified for the finals that year, and Dhoni contributed significantly. Although the team lost the final,
        Dhoni’s personal performance was a highlight — he scored a well-crafted 84 runs and stood out as the most
        consistent player. By the end of the season, he had accumulated 488 runs in nine matches, including five
        half-centuries, along with 17 catches and seven stumpings. This extraordinary season helped him establish
        himself as a rising talent in the Indian domestic cricket structure.

        His well-earned progress led to his selection for the East Zone Under-19 squad in the C.K. Nayudu Trophy.
        However, this tournament proved to be a learning experience rather than a triumph. Dhoni managed to score only
        97 runs in four matches, and the team finished at the bottom. Although the results were disappointing, Dhoni
        gained valuable exposure and experience that would later prove pivotal.

        Dhoni’s next major milestone was his entry into senior-level domestic cricket. At just 18 years old, he made his
        Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season. In his debut match against Assam, he scored a commendable
        68 runs in the second innings, signaling his potential to thrive at higher competitive levels. By the end of the
        season, Dhoni accumulated 283 runs in five matches and began gaining recognition as a dependable middle-order
        batsman.

        During the 2000–01 Ranji Trophy season, Dhoni reached an important personal milestone — he scored his first
        first-class century against the Bengal team. Although his overall consistency still fluctuated, the century
        served as a strong indication of his skill and future promise.

        In the next domestic season, 2001–02, Dhoni showed notable growth and consistency. He registered five
        half-centuries in just four matches, displaying his ability to adapt match after match and contribute in various
        conditions.

        A significant shift occurred when the state of Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar. Dhoni transitioned to
        represent the newly formed Jharkhand cricket team from the 2002–03 season onward. Alongside this, he continued
        to represent the East Zone in tournaments such as the Deodhar Trophy. During this period, Dhoni refined his
        aggressive batting style and became known for his ability to dominate bowlers — especially in pressure
        situations and limited-overs formats.

        The 2003–04 domestic season proved to be another important chapter in his growth. Dhoni played a memorable
        inning of 128 not out against Assam in the Ranji One-Day competition. His outstanding batting performances,
        combined with his dependable wicket-keeping, positioned him as a prospect for national recognition. He also
        played a strong role in helping East Zone win the Deodhar Trophy, scoring 244 runs in four matches.

        His consistency earned him a place in the Duleep Trophy finals, where his gritty half-century demonstrated
        resilience and fighting spirit, despite the team's loss.

        By now, Dhoni’s name had begun circulating among scouting circles. The BCCI’s Talent Resource Development Wing
        (TRDW) — an initiative designed to identify promising cricketers from smaller cities — played a pivotal role in
        spotlighting him. His performances and potential impressed the selectors.

        In 2004, Dhoni received one of the biggest breaks of his early cricketing life: he was selected for the India A
        tour to Zimbabwe and Kenya. During this tour, Dhoni demonstrated exceptional wicket-keeping skills. In a match
        against Zimbabwe XI at Harare Sports Club, he executed seven catches and four stumpings — a rare and outstanding
        performance.

        Dhoni further cemented his potential in the triangular series involving India A, Kenya, and Pakistan A. His
        batting form was remarkable — he scored a crucial half-century against Pakistan A during a run chase of 223, and
        throughout the series accumulated 362 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 72.40. His innings
        included back-to-back centuries, showcasing both consistency and confidence under pressure.

        This tour became a defining moment in Dhoni’s career. His exceptional performance caught the attention of Indian
        selectors, fans, and cricketing experts. It marked the turning point that paved his path toward the Indian
        national cricket team, setting the stage for his legendary international career. </p>

    <h2 id="international-career">International Career</h2>
    <p> The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper
        spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh
        Karthik.[35] With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh
        tour in December 2004.[36] Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[37]
        Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[38] In the second match of the series in
        Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which
        surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[39] Dhoni played in the Sri
        Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third
        ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[40] The innings
        would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and was described in Wisden
        Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[41] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket
        in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[42][43] Dhoni ended the series with
        the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.[44]


        Dhoni keeping wickets in a test match
        Dhoni became a regular in the Indian side after the home series against South Africa in November 2005.[45] In
        December 2005, Dhoni was awarded a "B" grade contract by the BCCI.[46] Dhoni made his test debut in the same
        month against Sri Lanka during their tour of India at Chennai.[47][48] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match,
        that was marred by rain and ended in a draw.[49] Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test leading
        to an Indian win.[50] Dhoni played all the matches in the subsequent tour of Pakistan scoring 219 runs in five
        ODI matches and 179 runs in five tests including his maiden test century in the second test in Faisalabad.[51]
        He scored 106 runs across three tests in the home series against England in March 2006 and 177 runs in five ODI
        series that followed.[51][45] Dhoni dropped multiple catches and missed dismissal chances including a key
        stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff which led to criticism of his wicket-keeping.[52]

        In the DLF Cup 2006-07, Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the
        finals. In the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy, India lost to West Indies and Australia, though Dhoni scored a
        half-century against West Indies and failed to make it to the knock out stage.[53] In the ODI series in South
        Africa in November 2006, Dhoni scored 139 runs in four matches in the series loss.[45] In the test series that
        followed, Dhoni scored 114 runs in two tests including a first test victory in South Africa in the first test,
        but was ruled out of the third test with injury.[54] Dhoni made his T20 international debut in December 2006
        against South Africa at Johannesburg.[55] Dhoni was subsequently named in the ODI team of the year by the ICC
        for 2006.[56]

        2007 World T20 and captaincy
        India recorded identical 3–1 victory over West Indies and Sri Lanka in early 2007 with Dhoni averaging more than
        100 in both the series. Subsequently, Dhoni was part of the squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup in which India
        unexpectedly crashed out in the group stage after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with Dhoni scoring ducks in
        both these matches and just 29 runs in the tournament.[45][57] As a result, Dhoni's house in Ranchi was
        vandalised and damaged by activists of JMM and security was tightened for his family.[58] Dhoni scored 91*
        against Bangladesh in the first match of the ODI series in May 2007 which got him the Man of the Match award
        while also later winning the Man of the Series award after the third game of the series was washed away.[59]
        Dhoni played for ACC Asia XI cricket team in the Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in three matches at an average
        of 87 including 139 off 97 balls in the third ODI.[60]

        Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the 2007 Future Cup against South Africa in Ireland and the
        subsequent seven-match series against England.[61] Dhoni was awarded an 'A' grade contract by BCCI in June
        2007.[62] Dhoni was appointed as the captain of the Indian squad for the inaugural World Twenty20 in September
        2007.[63] Dhoni led India to victory in the tournament after defeating Pakistan in the final.[64][65] Dhoni was
        later appointed as the captain of the Indian cricket team in all formats.[66]

        On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings
        in ODI by effecting six dismissals against England.[67] Dhoni took his first and only wicket in international
        cricket on 30 September 2009 when he bowled Travis Dowlin of West Indies in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy.[68]
        However, he scored just three runs in the only match he batted with India crashing out of the series in the
        group stage after the match against Australia was washed out.[69] Dhoni averaged more than 60 in the 2008-09
        season.[70] Dhoni scored two centuries during Sri Lanka's tour of India in November 2009 which India won to
        achieve the top ranking in ICC test ranking for the first time in its history.[71] Dhoni had an excellent year
        in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at an average of 70.43 and topped the ICC ODI batsman
        rankings for several months.[72] He was named as the captain and wicket-keeper of the ICC ODI Team of the
        year.[73]

        2011 World Cup win and later

        Cricket Museum
        Dhoni led the Indian squad for the 2011 Cricket World Cup co-hosted by India.[74] India won its second ever ODI
        world cup after defeating Sri Lanka in the final with Dhoni being named man of the match for scoring an unbeaten
        91.[75] In December 2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time in five years and
        Dhoni top-scored in all the three matches of the series with a century in the first ODI at Chennai.[76] Dhoni
        led India to victory in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and became the first and the only captain in international
        cricket to claim all ICC limited overs trophies. In the rain-shortened final against England, India won by five
        runs on DLS method though Dhoni himself was out for a duck.[77] He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of
        the 'Team of the Tournament' by the ICC.[78]

        After the Champions Trophy, India toured West Indies for a tri-nation tournament against the hosts and Sri
        Lanka.[79] Dhoni got injured at the start of the tournament thus ruling him out for most of the tournament. He
        returned to play the final where he was adjudged Man of the match for scoring 45 runs off 52 balls including 16
        runs in the final over to take India to victory by one wicket.[80] In November 2013, Dhoni became the second
        India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to aggregate more than thousand runs in ODIs against Australia.[81] India
        toured South Africa and New Zealand in the 2013–14 season. Though Dhoni scored 84 runs at an average of 48
        including one half-century against South Africa and 272 runs with three consecutive 50-plus scores against New
        Zealand, India lost both the series.[45] Dhoni himself reached 8000 runs in ODI in the series against New
        Zealand.[82] Dhoni led India in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 where India finished as runners-up after losing to
        Sri Lanka in the final.[83] He was named as captain and wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' by the
        ICC.[84]

        India won the away ODI series in England in 2014 and series against West Indies in India where Dhoni scored 146
        runs across the five innings he batted.[85][45]

        Test retirement and 2015 World cup
        Dhoni played his last series during India's tour of Australia in December 2014. Following the third Test in
        Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format.[86] In his last test, he effected nine dismissals
        (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara's record for most stumpings in
        international cricket and also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian
        wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018.[87][88] In the Carlton Mid triangular series in
        Australia, India failed to win a single match with Dhoni himself managing just 70 runs from three innings at an
        average of 23.34.[89]

        During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage matches in a
        world cup.[90] In the match against Zimbabwe at Auckland, he made 85 which was the highest score by an Indian
        captain in New Zealand. After beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the
        first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches.[91] India lost to eventual champions Australia in the
        semi-finals with Dhoni having a good series, scoring 237 runs in six innings at an average of 59.25 and a strike
        rate of 102.15, and thus, becoming the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and strike rate over 100
        in a particular season of the World Cup.[92][93]

        Final years and retirement
        Dhoni led India to victory in the 2016 Asia Cup, where India remained unbeaten.[94] Dhoni stepped down as the
        captain of India in January 2017, ahead of the ODI series at home against England.[95] In the second game of the
        series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, his tenth century in ODIs and his first in over three years.[96] He was
        named as a wicket-keeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy in which India
        finished as runners-up.[97][98] In August 2017, during the fifth and final ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo, he
        became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODIs when he stumped Akila Dananjaya off Yuzvendra
        Chahal.[99] He reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in ODIs in February 2018, following the
        stumping of Aiden Markram in the third ODI of the South Africa tour.[100]

        Though, he had a relatively mediocre series scoring 79 runs in two innings at a strike rate of 63.20 during
        India's 2018 tour of England, he went past 10,000 ODI runs, becoming the fourth Indian and twelfth overall to do
        so.[101][102][103] In the 2018 Asia Cup title winning campaign, he scored just 77 runs in four innings at an
        average of 19.25.[104][105] While captaining in the group stage match against Afghanistan due to regular captain
        Rohit Sharma being unavailable, Dhoni became the first cricketer to lead India 200 times in ODIs.[106] Dhoni
        aggregated 50 runs from three innings in the home series against West Indies.[107][108] In the series, he
        effected the fastest stumping in the history of cricket, clocked at 0.08 seconds, when dismissing Keemo
        Paul.[109][110]

        Dhoni was not selected for the T20I squad for the series that followed and the Australia tour later that
        season.[111] However, he was included in the squad for the ODI series in Australia.[112] In the three-match
        series, Dhoni scored half-centuries in all three games with the latter two resulting in wins, helping India
        secure a 2–1 series victory, their first in a bilateral series on Australian soil and was named player of the
        series while also becoming the fourth Indian to score more than 1,000 ODI runs in Australia.[113] In April 2019,
        he was named in India's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[114][115] On 9 July 2019, Dhoni played in his
        350th and final ODI in the semi-final loss against New Zealand.[116] On 15 August 2020, Dhoni formally announced
        his retirement from international cricket.[117]

        Post-international retirement
        On 8 September 2021, Dhoni was appointed as the mentor of the Indian team for the 2021 T20 World
        Cup.[118][119][120]</p>

    <p> Achievements and Legacy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni

        Mahendra Singh Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the most successful captains in cricket history. His
        leadership, composure, tactical intelligence, and extraordinary finishing ability have earned him admiration
        around the world. Over the course of his illustrious career, he has lifted major international trophies, led
        championship-winning teams in the IPL, and earned numerous awards and civilian honors.

        Below is an elaborated account of his achievements, trophies, honors, and cultural impact.

        🏏 Achievements with the Indian National Cricket Team

        Dhoni's captaincy journey began with a fearless attitude and a mindset focused on performance rather than
        pressure. His calmness on the field earned him the nickname “Captain Cool.”

        Under his leadership, India won some of the most prestigious tournaments in world cricket.

        T20 World Cup Victory – 2007

        In 2007, just months after being appointed captain, Dhoni led an inexperienced young Indian squad in the ICC T20
        World Cup held in South Africa.

        With his innovative decisions, unconventional field placements, and fearless backing of young players, India
        shocked the cricket world.

        The dramatic final against Pakistan ended with Misbah-ul-Haq’s attempted scoop shot landing safely into
        Sreesanth’s hands.

        This iconic moment marked India's first-ever T20 World Cup title.

        It also marked Dhoni’s arrival as a transformational leader.

        Asia Cup Titles – 2010, 2016, 2018

        Dhoni guided India to multiple Asia Cup victories during his tenure.

        In 2010, India showcased a confident and balanced approach under his tactical decisions.

        The 2016 Asia Cup, played in the T20 format, again saw India dominate the tournament.

        Even in 2018, although Dhoni was not captain, his experience and mentorship played a pivotal role in India’s
        success.

        Cricket World Cup – 2011

        One of Dhoni’s biggest achievements was leading India to win the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011.

        India had not won the ODI World Cup since 1983.

        Dhoni’s leadership ensured India topped group stages and performed consistently in the knockouts.

        The final against Sri Lanka at Wankhede Stadium became legendary.

        With pressure mounting, Dhoni promoted himself to bat ahead of Yuvraj Singh.

        His unbeaten 91*, sealed with the iconic six over long-on, became one of the most unforgettable moments in
        sports history.

        This victory united a nation and immortalized Dhoni in cricket folklore.

        ICC Champions Trophy – 2013

        In 2013, Dhoni guided India to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in England.

        India remained unbeaten throughout the tournament.

        This win made Dhoni the only captain in cricket history to win:

        ICC T20 World Cup

        ICC ODI World Cup

        ICC Champions Trophy

        🏆 Achievements in Domestic Tournaments (Chennai Super Kings)

        Apart from international cricket, Dhoni became a monumental figure in the Indian Premier League (IPL), leading
        Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to multiple titles.

        Indian Premier League Championships

        2010

        2011

        2018

        2021

        His leadership style in the IPL showcased trust in players, strategic bowling rotations, and calm death-over
        management.

        Champions League T20 Titles

        CSK also won the Champions League T20 in:

        2010

        2014

        His success with CSK built one of the strongest fan bases in world cricket.
